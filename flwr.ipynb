at sampling from the Dirichlet distribution. The probability sampling from the Dirichlet distribution will be repeated. Note: This is not a desired behavior. It is recommended to adjust the alpha or min_partition_size instead. Generating partitions by sampling from a list of very wide range of alpha values can be hard to achieve. Try reducing the range between maximum (0.5) and minimum alpha (0.5) values or increasing all the values.\u001b[32m [repeated 189x across cluster]\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[36m(ClientAppActor pid=91146)\u001b[0m   warnings.warn(\u001b[32m [repeated 189x across cluster]\u001b[0m\n"]}],"source":["backend_config = {\"client_resources\": None}\n","NUM_PARTITIONS = 10\n","run_simulation(\n","    server_app=server,\n","    client_app=client,\n","    num_supernodes=NUM_PARTITIONS,\n","    backend_config=backend_config,\n",")"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"nvidiaTeslaT4","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30787,"isGpuEnabled":true,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
