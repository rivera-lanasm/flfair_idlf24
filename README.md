# FairFed and Deep Learning
Evaluating Fairness of FL Methods and Criteria

- Initial Idea: [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qhE1ZlblD-FysCvw3abgrpd5G8mB60sN41SZsP0PySU/edit)

### Current Folder Structure
Please keep things organized.
- `toy`: Code not for final deliverable. Anything that isn't final should be in here.
- `custom_flwr`: Custom flwr code to implement our FairFed methods.
- `flwr.ipynb`: Notebook that runs FL experiment.

### Current Tasks
- [x] Implement Dirichlet Partitioning for Heterogeneous Data
- [x] Implement EOD metrics
    - [ ] Someone needs to check if the implementation is correct
- [x] Implement FairFed Strategy
- [ ] Implement Local Debiasing (Reweighting)
