# FairFed and Deep Learning
Evaluating Fairness of FL Methods and Criteria

- Initial Idea: [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qhE1ZlblD-FysCvw3abgrpd5G8mB60sN41SZsP0PySU/edit)

### Current Folder Structure
Please keep things organized.
- `toy`: Code not for final deliverable. Anything that isn't final should be in here.
- `custom_flwr`: Custom flwr code to implement our FairFed methods.
- `flwr.ipynb`: Notebook that runs FL experiment. To replicate our results, run this notebook.

- Changes to alpha are made in `flwr.ipynb` and `custom_flwr\task.py`.
- Changes to beta and gamma are made in `custom_flwr\server_app.py`.
